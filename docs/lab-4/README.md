# Tuning the Granite Model

Now that you've set up InstructLab, lets get tuning the Granite Model.

## Sanity check

Take a moment to verify that you are not running `ilab model chat` or `ilab model serve` anywhere,
it will clash with the following commands with training and tuning the model.

The Granite family of foundation models span an increasing variety of modalities, including language, code, time series, and science (e.g., materials) - with much more to come. We're building them with transparency and with focus on fulfilling rigorous enterprise requirements that are emerging for AI. If you'd like to learn more about the models themselves and how we build them, check out Granite Models.

The mission of the Granite Community organization is to work collaboratively across industries and geographies to leverage Granite to solve problems and bring value across use cases, from code generation and modernization, to forecasting and predictive maintenance, to materials discovery.

## Prepare to train your model

1) Pull down an example `qna.yaml`. But wait what is a `qna.yaml`? There's a few things you should know before going any further.

Knowledge is based more on answering questions that involve facts, data, or references.

Knowledge in the taxonomy tree consists of a few more elements than skills:

- Each knowledge node in the tree has a `qna.yaml`, similar to the format of the `qna.yaml` for skills.
- ‚≠ê Knowledge submissions require you to create a Git repository, can be with GitHub, that contains the markdown files of your knowledge contributions. These contributions in your repository must use the markdown (.md) format.
- The `qna.yaml` includes parameters that contain information from your repository.

!!! tip
    Guidelines for Knowledge contributions

    - Submit the most up-to-date version of the document
    - All submissions must be text, images will be ignored
    - Do not use tables in your markdown freeform contribution

Format of the `qna.yaml`:

- `version`: The cache version of the qna.yaml file, this is the format of the file used for SDG. The value must be the number 3.
- `created_by`: Your GitHub username.
- `domain`: Specify the category of the knowledge.
- `seed_examples`: A collection of key/value entries.
  - `context`: A chunk of information from the knowledge document. Each `qna.yaml` needs five `context` blocks and has a maximum word count of 500 words.
  - `questions_and_answers`: The parameter that holds your questions and answers
    - `question`: Specify a question for the model. Each `qna.yaml` file needs at least three question and answer pairs per `context` chunk with a maximum word count of 250 words.
    - `answer`: Specify the desired answer from the model. Each `qna.yaml` file needs at least three question and answer pairs per `context` chunk with a maximum word count of 250 words.
- `document_outline`: Describe an overview of the document your submitting.
- `document`: The source of your knowledge contribution.
  - `repo`: The URL to your repository that holds your knowledge markdown files.
  - `commit`: The SHA of the commit in your repository with your knowledge markdown files.
  - `patterns`: A list of glob patterns specifying the markdown files in your repository. Any glob pattern that starts with `*`, such as `*.md`, must be quoted due to YAML rules. For example, `"*.md"`.

## Putting the `qna.yaml` in the correct place

We need to put the `qna.yaml` like above to the correct place so we can actual do the training. The following commands pulls a copy of it down and puts it in your local `taxonomy` tree.

```bash
cd ~/.local/share/instructlab/taxonomy
mkdir -p knowledge/science/animals/hippos/
cd knowledge/science/animals/hippos/
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/instructlab/taxonomy/7ff90c1b7dd7760df130fc21cef46c6a8208048c/knowledge/science/animals/hippos/qna.yaml
cd -
```

!!! note
    If `wget` is not found, please run `brew install wget` that should get it on your laptop.


## Generating synthetic data

After you've built a good knowledge submission like above, the `qna.yaml`, the `attribution.txt` and
finally the hosted `.md` file, you need to tell the teacher model to build questions around
your seeded ones. Lets do that now.

1) If you haven't yet, you'll need to pull down the default teacher model, this is done with this command:

```bash
ilab model download
```

2) Next we need to generate the data, this is done with the following command:

```bash
ilab data generate
```

This can take some time, take note of the time in the right hand corner, this is building 1000 questions off of your initial 15.
This takes the granite model, leverages the tokenized version of it, and runs the SDG from the `generate` command against it.

3) After this is complete, now we'll need to train the actual model. If this isn't a Mac M3, this will take **at least an hour**, so
hopefully you can take a lunch break or something while this is running.

```bash
ilab model train --pipeline simple
```

4) When this is completed, you'll need to test this model, which is the following command:

```bash
lab model test --model-dir ~/.local/share/instructlab/instructlab-granite-7b-lab --adapter-file ~/.local/share/instructlab/checkpoints/instructlab-granite-7b-lab-mlx-q/adapters-100.npz --data-dir ~/.local/share/instructlab/datasets
```

5) Now to run the command on the Mac M3, or Apple hardware you'll need to convert it to a `gguf`, that is this next command.


```bash
ilab model convert --adapter-file ~/.local/share/instructlab/checkpoints/instructlab-granite-7b-lab-mlx-q/adapters-100.npz --model-dir ~/.local/share/instructlab/checkpoints/instructlab-granite-7b-lab-mlx-q
```

6) Finally run the new model with `ilab model serve`.

```bash
ilab model serve --model-path instructlab-granite-7b-lab-trained/instructlab-granite-7b-lab-Q4_K_M.gguf
```

Success! You should notice a difference in the knowledge from what you've trained. If you haven't or something isn't working as expected please understand
that the way [quantization](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/en/concept_guides/quantization#) happens to run on your laptop sometimes causes the model to
not know what you trained it. We have some evidence that 1 out of 5 models trained retains your submissions when running on your local laptop. Don't fret
though your submission is great for the upstream model, and extremely valuable to the project.

When the full run from the upstream happens, the PR you submit with the new (or corrected) knowledge will be "baked in" better then the quantization
method you use here, which will give much higher percentage of retrieval.
