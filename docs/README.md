# Introduction

## Open Source AI Workshop

Welcome to our workshop! In this workshop we'll be using a local AI Model for code completion, as well as training a model
locally to help it gain some knowledge.

* Understand what Open Source AI is, and its general use cases
* How to use an AI model that is built in a verifiable and legal way
* Learn a suggested workflow on how to fine tune a model with new knowledge and skills!
