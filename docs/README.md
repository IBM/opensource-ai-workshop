## Open Source AI Workshop

You've probably heard how tools like ChatGPT are changing workflows — but when it comes to privacy, security, and control, using public AI tools isn't always an option. In this hands-on workshop, you'll learn how to run your own local, open-source LLMs — no cloud, no cost, and no compromise.

We'll walk through installing and running models with tools like ollama, AnythingLLM, and Continue using familiar environments like VS Code. By the end, you'll have a fully functional local AI assistant, ready to support your work securely and offline.

Our overarching goals of this workshop is as follows:

* Learn about Open Source AI and its general use cases.
* Use an open source LLM that is built in a verifiable and legal way.
* Learn about Prompt Engineering and how to leverage a local LLM in daily tasks.

!!! tip
    Working with AI is all about exploration and hands-on engagement. These labs are designed to give you everything you need to get started — so you can collaborate, experiment, and learn together. Don’t hesitate to ask questions, raise your hand, and connect with other participants.
