## Open Source AI workshop

Welcome to our workshop! Thank you for trusting us to help you learn about this
new and exciting space. There is a lot going on here, and we want to give you
enough to be able to feel confident in consuming LLM(s) and ideally find success
quickly. In this workshop we'll be using a local AI Model for code completion,
and learning best practices leveraging an Open Source LLM.

Our overarching goals of this workshop is as follows:

* Understand what Open Source AI is, and its general use cases
* How to use an Open Source AI model that is built in a verifiable and legal way
* Learn about Prompt Engineering, how to leverage a local LLM in starter daily tasks

!!! tip
    This workshop may seem short, but a lot of working with AI is exploration and engagement.
    These labs is set up for you to get "everything you need to start" put together so you
    can share in a collaborative learning environment and shared exploration. Don't hesitate
    to raise your hand ask questions and engage with the other students.

    By the time you leave today, you'll have everything you need leverage this on your laptop
    at home, without internet access, in a secure manner.
