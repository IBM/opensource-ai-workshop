## Open Source AI workshop

Welcome to the Open Source AI workshop! Thank you for trusting us to help you learn about this
new and exciting space. In this workshop, you'll gain the skills and confidence to effectively use LLMs locally through simple exercises and experimentation, and learn best practices for leveraging open source AI.

Our overarching goals of this workshop is as follows:

* Learn about Open Source AI and its general use cases.
* Use an open source LLM that is built in a verifiable and legal way.
* Learn about Prompt Engineering and how to leverage a local LLM in daily tasks.

!!! tip
    This workshop may seem short, but a lot of working with AI is exploration and engagement.
    These labs is set up for you to get "everything you need to start" put together so you
    can share in a collaborative learning environment and shared exploration. Don't hesitate
    to raise your hand ask questions and engage with the other students.

    By the time you leave today, you'll have everything you need leverage this on your laptop
    at home, without internet access, in a secure manner.
